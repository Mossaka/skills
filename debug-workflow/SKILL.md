# Workflow Debugging

Debug agentic workflow runs using `gh aw audit` and `gh aw logs` commands.

## Core Commands

### Audit a Specific Run

Investigate a single workflow run with comprehensive error detection:

```bash
./gh-aw audit <run-id-or-url> --parse -v
```

**Accepts:**
- Numeric run ID: `21005890162`
- GitHub Actions URL: `https://github.com/owner/repo/actions/runs/21005890162`
- Job URL: `https://github.com/owner/repo/actions/runs/21005890162/job/9876543210`
- Job URL with step: `https://github.com/owner/repo/actions/runs/21005890162/job/9876543210#step:7:1`

**What it does:**
- Downloads artifacts and logs to `.github/aw/logs/run-<id>/`
- Detects errors and warnings
- Analyzes MCP tool usage statistics
- Generates detailed Markdown report
- Extracts specific step output (if job URL with step)

**Output location:** `.github/aw/logs/run-<run-id>/`

### Download Multiple Runs

Analyze patterns across multiple workflow executions:

```bash
./gh-aw logs [workflow] --count <N> --parse
```

**Common options:**
- `--count 10` - Download last 10 runs
- `--start-date -1w` - Last week's runs
- `--end-date -1d` - Until yesterday
- `--engine claude` - Filter by engine (claude/codex/copilot)
- `--firewall` - Filter runs with firewall enabled
- `--safe-output create-issue` - Filter by safe output type
- `--parse` - Generate Markdown reports
- `--json` - JSON output format

**Output location:** `.github/aw/logs/` (configurable with `-o`)

## Debugging Workflow

### Step 1: Audit the Run

Start with the audit command to get a comprehensive overview:

```bash
./gh-aw audit <run-url> --parse -v
```

Review the generated report for:
- ✅ Success indicators
- 🟡 Warnings
- ❌ Errors
- Token usage and performance metrics
- Job status and duration
- Tool usage statistics

### Step 2: Examine Logs

Navigate to the downloaded logs:

```bash
cd .github/aw/logs/run-<id>/
```

**Key files:**
- `agent-stdio.log` - Full agent execution log (search here for errors)
- `aw_info.json` - Workflow metadata and configuration
- `workflow-logs/` - GitHub Actions job logs
- `mcp-logs/gateway.md` - MCP Gateway status and requests
- `mcp-logs/mcp-gateway.log` - Raw MCP Gateway logs
- `sandbox/firewall/logs/access.log` - Firewall access logs (if enabled)
- `safe_output.jsonl` - Agent's final output (if available)

### Step 3: Search for Common Issues

Use the quick scan script for rapid error detection:

```bash
scripts/quick_scan.sh .github/aw/logs/run-<id>/
```

Or search manually for specific patterns:

**MCP server failures:**
```bash
grep -E "mcp:.*failed" agent-stdio.log
```

**DNS resolution errors:**
```bash
grep "dns error.*Name does not resolve" agent-stdio.log
```

**OAuth/authentication issues:**
```bash
grep "WARN codex_rmcp_client::oauth" agent-stdio.log
```

**Tool availability errors:**
```bash
grep -i "tool.*not available\|tool.*failed" agent-stdio.log
```

**Firewall blocks:**
```bash
grep "TCP_DENIED" sandbox/firewall/logs/access.log
```

### Step 4: Check MCP Gateway

Review MCP Gateway logs to verify server connectivity:

```bash
cat mcp-logs/gateway.md
```

Look for:
- ✓ Successfully loaded servers
- 🔍 RPC request/response pairs
- ⚠️ HTTP errors (404, 500, etc.)
- ✓ Tools list responses

### Step 5: Analyze Root Cause

Consult the common errors reference for known patterns:

```bash
cat references/common_errors.md
```

This document catalogs:
- MCP server failures (DNS, OAuth, session)
- Firewall issues
- Agent execution errors
- GitHub Actions problems

### Step 6: Document Findings

Create an issue to document the problem:

```bash
gh issue create \
  --repo <owner/repo> \
  --title "<concise-issue-title>" \
  --body "<detailed-description>"
```

Include:
- Workflow run URL
- Summary of the issue
- Evidence from logs (error messages)
- Root cause analysis
- Impact assessment
- Reproduction steps
- Suggested fixes

## Common Patterns

### Silent MCP Failures

**Symptom:** Workflow shows green but agent couldn't use MCP tools

**Detection:**
```bash
./gh-aw audit <run-id> -v
grep -E "mcp:.*failed" .github/aw/logs/run-<id>/agent-stdio.log
```

**Causes:**
- DNS resolution failure (`host.docker.internal`)
- OAuth token issues
- MCP Gateway not reachable
- Session not found errors

**Reference:** See `references/common_errors.md` for detailed patterns

### False Success

**Symptom:** Workflow completed successfully but didn't produce expected results

**Investigation:**
1. Check for MCP server failures (tools unavailable)
2. Check for firewall blocks (network requests failed)
3. Review agent output for errors
4. Verify safe outputs were created

### Network Issues

**Detection:**
```bash
grep "TCP_DENIED\|TAG_NONE" sandbox/firewall/logs/access.log
```

**Causes:**
- Domain not in firewall allowlist
- DNS resolution through proxy failed
- Network timeout

## Tips

**Green doesn't mean success:** Always audit the logs even if the workflow shows as successful. Many failures are silent.

**Use audit first:** The audit command provides a comprehensive overview and is faster than manually downloading and examining logs.

**Check all MCP servers:** If one MCP server fails, check if others also failed—this indicates a systemic issue like DNS or networking.

**Firewall logs are crucial:** When debugging network issues, always check firewall access logs for blocked domains.

**Look for patterns:** Use the logs command to download multiple runs and identify patterns across executions.

**Reference common errors:** Before deep investigation, check `references/common_errors.md` for known patterns and solutions.
